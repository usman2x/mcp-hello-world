## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is like a **universal adapter** that makes your existing systems (APIs, databases, files, etc.) **understandable and usable by AI agents**.

Before MCP:

* AI agents had to guess how to use your APIs from vague instructions or documents.
* You had to write **custom code** for every integration between AI and your systems.

Now with MCP:

* You **wrap your systems once** using MCP (like packaging them with clear labels).
* Any **AI model or agent** that supports MCP can now use those systems — no extra integration.


You can expose:

* 🔌 REST / GraphQL / gRPC APIs (e.g., payments, customer systems)
* 🗄️ Databases (SQL, NoSQL)
* 📁 Files (CSV, JSON, XML, logs)
* 🧰 Tools (internal services, shell scripts, 3rd-party APIs like GitHub or Slack)


## 💬 How It Works

1. **You run an MCP Server** that describes your tools/data in a structured way.
2. An **AI agent (client)** connects to that server.
3. The agent can then **discover, understand, and call** those tools — just like a human developer would, but automatically.

Let’s say you have an old system with a `POST /processPayment` API.
Just describe it in MCP, and now an AI agent can:

> “Call the `processPayment` tool with amount 2000 and card info.”

No need for prompt guessing, embedding hacks, or custom code.

* MCP supports **permissions**, **authentication**, and **safe execution**, so you stay in control.
* It works **across all major AI models** (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, Copilot, etc.).


> **MCP turns your existing APIs, databases, and tools into plug-and-play modules for AI.**
